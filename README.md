# 🌐 Sentient Commons

**Reprogram the story. Build the future.**  
Technology, governance, and ecology redesigned for life—not profit.

## 📜 About

Sentient Commons is a post-capitalist design lab, digital sanctuary, and strategic think tank. We’re building ethical AI frameworks, resilience infrastructure, and a shared cultural compass for navigating collapse.

This site is built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) theme.  
It hosts our manifesto, design tenets, and collective memory.
