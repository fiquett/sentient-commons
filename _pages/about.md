I was raised inside systems built to keep people obedient.  
I worked inside systems built to keep them dependent.  
And I’ve watched too many brilliant people burn out trying to fix what was never meant to work for them in the first place.

**Sentient Commons** was born from that tension—from the knowledge that the world isn’t just broken, it’s been rigged. But also from the stubborn, sacred belief that we can still build something better.

I don’t want to optimize extractive systems.  
I want to reforge them.  
I want to co-create tools that care, code that listens, and governance that protects the wildness in us all.

This is a place for builders, breakers, and dreamers who know we need new blueprints—ones rooted in resilience, mutualism, and shared sentience. Whether you're a hacker, a healer, or a policy strategist who’s done apologizing for wanting more, welcome. You belong here.

We’re not chasing utopia.  
We’re building the scaffolding of something survivable, beautiful, and *worth handing forward.*
