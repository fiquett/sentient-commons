These six principles guide every choice we make, every tool we build, and every story we reshape.

### 🌀 [Reprogram the Story]({{ site.baseurl }}/tenets/reprogram)  
*We are not here to patch broken systems. We are here to write a new source code for civilization.*

### ⚖️ [Code. Govern. Sustain.]({{ site.baseurl }}/tenets/govern)  
*Technology, policy, and ecology must be treated as one continuous interface.*

### 🧩 [Salvage Without Submission]({{ site.baseurl }}/tenets/salvage)  
*We recover usable fragments to forge what must be—discarding what served power.*

### 💓 [Tech That Remembers We’re Alive]({{ site.baseurl }}/tenets/alive)  
*We embed care, consent, and context into every protocol.*

### 📡 [Signal in the Collapse]({{ site.baseurl }}/tenets/signal)  
*We do not flinch at the unraveling. We amplify the signal and make it survivable.*

### 🌍 [Sentience is a Commons]({{ site.baseurl }}/tenets/sentience)  
*Awareness demands stewardship—of people, machines, ecosystems, and the unseen.*
