<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>In May 2025, the U.S. Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) officially withdrew a proposed rule that would have enforced consent requirements for the sale of sensitive personal data by third-party brokers. This decision, spearheaded by Acting Director Russell Vought, reflects a growing deregulatory agenda that endangers consumer autonomy, national security, and the ethical foundations of digital society. This article outlines the policy reversal, the actors involved, and the implications for civil liberties in the context of increasing state-corporate convergence.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-introduction">1. Introduction</h2>

<p>The commodification of personal data—location history, biometric identifiers, religious affiliation, financial records—is not a future threat. It is an ongoing crisis. At the heart of this surveillance economy lies the opaque and largely unregulated <strong>data brokerage industry</strong>, a sector estimated to exceed <strong>$250 billion globally by 2025</strong> (<a href="https://privacyrights.org/">Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, 2023</a>).</p>

<p>In December 2024, under Director Rohit Chopra, the CFPB proposed a regulation titled <em>“Protecting Americans from Harmful Data Broker Practices.”</em> The rule sought to classify data brokers under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), requiring them to obtain informed consent before collecting or reselling personal data. However, as of May 14, 2025, this rule has been rescinded (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/public-inspection/2025-08644">Federal Register, 2025</a>).</p>

<h2 id="2-key-stakeholders-and-motivations">2. Key Stakeholders and Motivations</h2>

<h3 id="21-regulatory-sabotage-by-political-appointees">2.1 Regulatory Sabotage by Political Appointees</h3>

<p>Russell Vought, formerly the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, cited an updated “interpretation” of the FCRA in withdrawing the rule (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-quietly-kills-rule-to-shield-americans-from-data-brokers/">WIRED, 2025</a>). Critics, including Sean Vitka of Demand Progress and veterans’ group Common Defense, condemned the move as a deliberate capitulation to data brokers, with <strong>no clear public safety rationale</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="22-corporate-lobbying-and-the-fintech-complex">2.2 Corporate Lobbying and the Fintech Complex</h3>

<p>The <strong>Financial Technology Association (FTA)</strong>—a trade group representing fintech firms—issued a formal letter opposing the regulation, arguing it would “exceed statutory mandate” and “hinder fraud prevention” (<a href="https://www.ftassociation.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/FTA-Letter-on-OMB-Deregulation-RFI.pdf">FTA Letter, May 2025</a>). This language mirrors industry patterns of framing data extraction as a security necessity—a rhetorical inversion used to <strong>justify surveillance capitalism</strong> (<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237698">Zuboff, 2019</a>).</p>

<h2 id="3-the-real-world-harm-of-unregulated-data-trade">3. The Real-World Harm of Unregulated Data Trade</h2>

<h3 id="31-national-security-risks">3.1 National Security Risks</h3>

<p>A 2023 research study funded by the U.S. Military Academy at West Point concluded that current data broker practices pose a “clear and present threat to U.S. national security” by facilitating the identification and targeting of military personnel through de-anonymized datasets (<a href="https://techpolicy.sanford.duke.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/11/Sherman-et-al-2023-Data-Brokers-and-the-Sale-of-Data-on-US-Military-Personnel.pdf">Sherman et al., 2023</a>).</p>

<p>Data leaked by firms such as <strong>Gravy Analytics</strong> and <strong>Mobilewalla</strong> have exposed granular movements of political officials, defense contractors, and active service members (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/google-dv360-banned-audience-segments-national-security/">WIRED, 2023</a>).</p>

<h3 id="32-personal-safety-and-domestic-abuse">3.2 Personal Safety and Domestic Abuse</h3>

<p>According to the <strong>Safety Net Project</strong> of the National Network to End Domestic Violence, people-search engines that purchase brokered data can allow abusers to track victims even after relocation or identity changes (<a href="https://www.techsafety.org/data-brokers">TechSafety.org, 2024</a>).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-the-cfpbs-gutting-dismantling-accountability">4. The CFPB’s Gutting: Dismantling Accountability</h2>

<p>As reported by WIRED, more than <strong>1,400 CFPB employees were laid off in April 2025</strong>, leaving only a skeletal agency incapable of meaningful enforcement (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/cfpb-has-been-gutted/">WIRED, 2025</a>). This administrative evisceration coincided with calls from Elon Musk—now head of the <strong>Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</strong>—to eliminate the CFPB entirely (<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-digital-coup-doge-data-ai/">WIRED, 2025</a>).</p>

<p>The result is <strong>not just deregulation—it is decapitation</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-ethical-and-legal-dimensions">5. Ethical and Legal Dimensions</h2>

<h3 id="51-consent-as-a-cornerstone-of-democratic-systems">5.1 Consent as a Cornerstone of Democratic Systems</h3>

<p>Consent, in data ethics, is not merely symbolic. It is foundational. Its removal creates a legal architecture in which <strong>involuntary surveillance becomes normalized</strong>—a system that philosopher Shoshana Zuboff describes as “a coup from above” (<a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674237698">Zuboff, 2019</a>).</p>

<h3 id="52-international-precedents-and-comparative-models">5.2 International Precedents and Comparative Models</h3>

<p>The <strong>EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</strong> enshrines consent, data minimization, and the right to be forgotten—principles <strong>absent</strong> from the American regulatory landscape (<a href="https://gdpr.eu/">GDPR.eu, 2024</a>). The U.S. is increasingly anomalous in permitting corporate actors to commodify behavioral data without opt-in mechanisms.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="6-recommendations">6. Recommendations</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Reinstate and Expand the CFPB’s Mandate</strong><br />
Include specific language affirming FCRA applicability to data brokers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Enact Federal Opt-In Privacy Legislation</strong><br />
Modeled after GDPR, with criminal penalties for violations.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Publicly Funded Watchdog Infrastructure</strong><br />
Create independent data rights enforcement bodies with authority to audit brokers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Citizen Literacy and Encryption Campaigns</strong><br />
Empower the public with tools to resist passive data harvesting.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The revocation of the CFPB’s proposed rule is not just a policy shift. It is a <strong>moral failure</strong>—one that reveals the fragile illusion of control in the digital age. To reclaim that control, we must redefine data rights as <strong>human rights</strong>, and dismantle the structures that mistake consent for inconvenience.</p>

<p>If the state will not defend us from predation, then we must defend each other.</p>

<p><strong>Imagine this:</strong></p>

<p>A stranger knows your income, your credit score, your home address, your location at 2:36 PM yesterday, who you voted for, what religion you left, and whether you’re pregnant.</p>

<p>Now imagine you never told them.<br />
Because you didn’t.<br />
Because they bought it.</p>

<p>Welcome to the United States of Surveillance.<br />
Where a decision made this week by a man you’ve never voted for just told the entire data broker industry: <strong>carry on.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-just-happened">What Just Happened</h2>

<p>On <strong>May 14, 2025</strong>, the <strong>Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)</strong>, led by <strong>acting director Russell Vought</strong>, <strong>withdrew a proposed rule</strong> that would have forced data brokers to <strong>get your consent</strong> before selling your sensitive personal data—your Social Security number, your financial history, your behavioral profile<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The rule, proposed under former CFPB director <strong>Rohit Chopra</strong>, was designed to classify data brokers under the <strong>Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)</strong>, giving you back some control. But this week, the bureau declared that protecting you was “no longer necessary or appropriate”<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Translation:<br />
<strong>Your consent is officially optional.</strong></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="the-stakes">The Stakes</h2>

<p>Data brokers aren’t just annoying.<br />
They’re dangerous.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In 2023, <strong>Gravy Analytics</strong> leaked movement data for military and government officials<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><strong>Arity</strong>, a subsidiary of Allstate, allegedly sold driver data for <strong>over 45 million Americans</strong> without their knowledge<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</li>
  <li><strong>People-search websites</strong>, fed by brokers, help <strong>abusers stalk their victims</strong><sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>.</li>
  <li>A <strong>West Point-funded study</strong> confirmed these ecosystems are an <strong>active national security threat</strong>—capable of <strong>identifying, profiling, and blackmailing</strong> service members<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>And it’s not just theoretical.</strong><br />
Foreign governments have already <strong>bought access to this data</strong>, using it to track military personnel around sensitive U.S. installations<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="why-they-did-it">Why They Did It</h2>

<p>Because lobbying works.<br />
Because profit beats privacy.<br />
Because <strong>you’re not the customer—you’re the product</strong>.</p>

<p>The <strong>Financial Technology Association</strong> sent Vought a letter this week urging him to scrap the rule, claiming it would hurt “fraud detection”<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>. That same tired line—used to justify everything from illegal surveillance to facial recognition dragnet tech.</p>

<p>And it worked.</p>

<p>So now, with <strong>zero public hearings</strong>, a <strong>rule built on over 600 citizen comments</strong> just evaporated.<br />
No debate. No warning. No vote.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="whats-left-of-the-watchdog">What’s Left of the Watchdog?</h2>

<p>The CFPB used to be one of the last federal agencies still trying to fight for consumers.<br />
That changed fast.</p>

<p>Over <strong>1,400 employees were laid off last month</strong>, leaving only 300 to police a trillion-dollar economy<sup id="fnref:9"><a href="#fn:9" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">9</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Elon Musk’s <strong>Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)</strong>—yes, that’s real—has pushed to <strong>dismantle the agency entirely</strong><sup id="fnref:10"><a href="#fn:10" class="footnote" rel="footnote" role="doc-noteref">10</a></sup>.<br />
Musk himself has said the CFPB should be “deleted.”</p>

<p>Meanwhile, <strong>your data keeps moving</strong>—across servers, into dossiers, into hands you’ll never see.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="what-you-can-do">What You Can Do</h2>

<h3 id="-get-loud">🔥 Get Loud</h3>
<p>Call your representatives. Tag them. Blow up their inboxes. Demand legislation requiring <strong>opt-in consent</strong> for any sale of personal data.</p>

<h3 id="-opt-out-where-you-still-can">🔥 Opt Out (Where You Still Can)</h3>
<p>Use services like <a href="https://joindeleteme.com">DeleteMe</a>, <a href="https://www.jumboprivacy.com">Jumbo</a>, or <a href="https://simpleoptout.com">SimpleOptOut</a> to fight back.</p>

<h3 id="-encrypt-everything">🔥 Encrypt Everything</h3>
<p>Signal, VPNs, Firefox, privacy-respecting tools. Make tracking you <strong>expensive</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="-vote">🔥 Vote</h3>
<p>For the love of all things digital and sacred—<strong>vote like your privacy depends on it</strong>.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="final-word">Final Word</h2>

<p>You are not a datapoint.<br />
You are not an ad segment.<br />
You are not a profile to be auctioned off.</p>

<p>You are a person.<br />
And consent isn’t optional.</p>

<p>Not anymore.</p>
